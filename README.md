Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Heart Disease dataset, where Heart Disease is the target variable.
The goal is to understand the data, identify important patterns, handle data quality issues, and prepare the dataset for future machine learning modeling.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset

Analyze relationships between features and heart disease

Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature scaling

Visualize data distributions and patterns using various plots

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient health-related attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Cholesterol

Blood Pressure

Chest Pain Type

ECG Results

And other medical indicators

Target Variable:

HeartDisease

1 → Presence of heart disease

0 → No heart disease

🛠️ Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing and invalid values

Replaced unrealistic values (e.g., zeros where not medically valid)

Ensured data consistency and correctness

2️⃣ Encoding

Converted categorical variables into numerical format

Applied appropriate encoding techniques for model compatibility

3️⃣ Feature Scaling

Applied Standard Scaling to normalize numerical features

Ensured all features are on a comparable scale

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Univariate Analysis

Histograms

KDE plots

Box plots

Used to understand:

Data distribution

Skewness

Outliers

🔹 Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Count plots to analyze target variable distribution

Violin plots to study feature distributions across heart disease classes

Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables

5️⃣ Visualization Techniques Used

Count Plot

Box Plot

Violin Plot

Histogram

KDE Plot

Correlation Heatmap

🔍 Key Insights

Certain medical features show strong correlation with heart disease

Some features have skewed distributions and outliers

Class imbalance is present in the target variable

Feature scaling is essential for future model performance
